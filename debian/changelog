  * Stop checking for c++11 support (#87 <https://github.com/ros/class_loader/pull/87>)

    * simplify branching
  * [fix warnings] c++11 requires at least one argument for ... (#71 <https://github.com/ros/class_loader/issues/71>)
  * [linter] Use std::string::empty instead comparing with an empty string (#69 <https://github.com/ros/class_loader/issues/69>)

ros-melodic-class-loader (0.3.6-0stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Made changes to two locking mechanisms inside class loader core's loadLibrary() function: 1) I added a lock to the 'addClassLoaderOwnerFor...' function to protect it against a race condition with the unloadLibrary() function. 2) I also raised the loader lock to cover the whole function. Previously the check to see if a library is already loaded and the actual loading of the library was not atomic. Multiple threads could create shared library objects, for example.
